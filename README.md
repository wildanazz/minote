## Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: The backend is modularized into microservices, each handling distinct functionalities, improving maintainability.
- **Containerized with Docker**: Each service is containerized, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Kubernetes Orchestration**: Kubernetes is used to manage, scale, and load balance the microservices.
- **React-based Frontend**: A dynamic and responsive frontend for seamless note management.
- **Real-time Sync**: Updates to notes are reflected across devices in real-time.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale the application by adding more instances of microservices as needed.
- **Cross-platform Accessibility**: Accessible on any device with a web browser.

## Architecture
The Minote app follows a microservices architecture, divided into:

1. **Client (React)**: The frontend interface where users interact with the app.
2. **Server (Node.js)**: Handles requests from the frontend, processes data, and interacts with the database.
3. **Kubernetes (K8s)**: Manages the deployment of the services and ensures high availability.

Each microservice communicates via RESTful APIs, and they are containerized using Docker.

### Folder Structure
- `/client`: React app code for the frontend
- `/server`: Backend code for the microservices
- `/k8s`: Kubernetes deployment configurations (YAML files)

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Database**: MongoDB (or similar NoSQL solution)
- **API**: RESTful services
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) (Minikube or a cloud provider like GKE, EKS, or AKS)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wildanazz/minote.git
    cd minote
    ```

2. Install dependencies for the client and server:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    cd ../server
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the app.

## Deployment

### Docker
Minote uses Docker to containerize the application for easy deployment across different environments.

1. Build the Docker images:
    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    ```

2. Run the services:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

### Kubernetes
For production deployment, Kubernetes is used to manage the applicationâ€™s services.

1. Apply Kubernetes configurations:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f k8s/
    ```

2. Verify the services are running:
    ```bash
    kubectl get services
    ```

3. Expose the application:
    ```bash
    kubectl expose deployment minote --type=LoadBalancer --name=minote-service
    ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Configure the following environment variables before running the application:
- `PORT`: Port where the backend server runs.
- `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB connection string.
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "development" for local development.

### Kubernetes Configurations
- **Deployment Files**: Located in `/k8s`, containing YAML files for defining pods, services, and scaling configurations.

## Usage
Once the application is up and running:
- Access the frontend at `http://localhost:<PORT>` and start managing your notes.
- Use the intuitive UI to create, edit, and delete notes.
- All notes are synced across devices in real-time.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Docker Build Failures**: Ensure Docker is installed and running. Run `docker info` to check.
- **Kubernetes Pods Not Running**: Check the pod logs using `kubectl logs <pod-name>`.
- **Connection Issues**: Ensure all microservices are correctly configured to communicate with each other via their respective endpoints.

### Logs
Use Docker or Kubernetes logs to debug any issues:
```bash
docker logs <container-id>
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```
